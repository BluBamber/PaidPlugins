> A community-driven repository for sharing Roblox Studio plugins freely, bypassing regional restrictions and monetization barriers.

## About

Roblox discontinued Robux-based plugin sales and limited USD transactions to specific regions, excluding many countries from plugin monetization. This repository provides an alternative where developers worldwide can share their work.

## Quick Start

**For Users:**
```
1. Browse plugins/ directory
2. Download .rbxm files
3. Import to Roblox Studio
```

**For Developers:**
```
1. Go to %localappdata% and navigate to the Roblox folder
2. Find folders with userids as names, go to the one you own paid plugins in
3. Make sure you have them installed in Roblox Studio or else they won't show up
4. Find the plugins rbxm or rbxmx with their asset id as the name
5. Upload those here! (we appreciate if you could rename them to be the plugin's name)
6. Fork this repository and submit pull request
```
